%% Other setup
% RNG seed - un-commenting & setting this will give you reproducible results, i.e. results
% with the same code using the same seed should be identical despite stochasticity
% From MATLAB docs: 
    %Specify seed as a nonnegative integer, such as rng(1), to initialize the random number generator with that seed.
    %Specify seed as "shuffle" to initialize the generator seed based on the current time.

%rng(2);


% Troubleshooting param - how many matings are being skipped? 
nSkip = zeros(tMax,1);

% Define bin edges based on nBins
edges = (0:(1/nBins):1);

% Viability fn:
d = makedist('Normal','mu',0.5,'sigma',sigM);
dMax = pdf(d,0.5);
    % Viability at phenotype p (0 < p < 1) is = pdf(d,p) / dMax
    % Normalized by dMax so max is 1 regardless of sigma


% Setup figures

% Define title ahead of time so it is across all subplots

    % Mate choice

        % In order to have females choose from bins (categorical) per the 
        % female preference function - i.e., to have her choose around the sum
        % of her own preference loci, following a distribution:
        % e.g. assume 5 bins, the probability that she will choose a male 
        % from a bin is proportional to the bin's height in her fitness function: 
        %
        %      â–ˆ 
        %    â–ˆ â–ˆ â–ˆ
        % '_'_'_'_'_'
        %  1 2 3 4 5
        %
        % ^ In this case, she is most likely to choose a male from bin 3,
        %   but may instead choose one in 2 or 4; she will not choose 1 or 5. 
        %
        % Female will select from all males with each male weighted 
        % according to the value/weight of its bin in her fitness function.

    % Store bin number for females to match with males, from preference loci
    discF = discretize(F(:,2).', edges ).';
    % Initialize array for storing preference wts for each male,
    % for females in each bin:
    wtsM = zeros(size(M,1), nBins); %need to use size of M because of natsel

    % Not fully preallocated because length is stochastic, but initialized:
    % (stores pairing information)
    O = [];

    for b = 1:nBins
      if ~sum(discF==b) %if no females in bin, move to next bin
        nSkip(t,1) = nSkip(t,1) +1; % For troubleshooting - store that matings were skipped
        continue
      end  

      % From discM, need to calc weights from  for each male index, per bin
      % The following replaces the discretized "bin numbers" in discM,
      % preserving index, with the associated weights for that bin given
      % the current (female) bin:
      wtsM = changem(discM,wts(:,b),1:nBins); 
      % These weights can be passed to datasample so she selects from all
      % males, each with an associated weight based on the preference
      % function and her preferred bin.
            
      % Using datasample(), pull random rows from males, using weights;
      % WITH REPLACEMENT (polygyny)
      % with output array size rows = (nFemales with bin b)
      % Add male rows to the rows for the females in question -
      % see explanation of haploid mating in Of, Om below.

      O = [O; datasample(M, sum(discF==b), 'Weights', wtsM)...
        + F(discF==b,:)];
      % O stores the PAIRINGS, from which the OFFSPRING will be randomly
      % extracted below in Of, Om.
    end

    % Offspring (O) may not be as long as F or M  if no males in bin
    % Draw from pairings (O) randomly until count reaches n; males and females
        Of = O(randsample(1:size(O,1),n,true).',:);

    % HAPLOID MATING
    % This is done in a slightly unusual way for performance & to avoid loops.
    % It assumes free recombination (r = 0.5).
    % The binary loci from the male and female are added together, creating
    % values of 0, 1, or 2. 
    % Divide the values by 2; now values are:
        % For mating 0x0 at locus = 0
        % For mating 1x0 at locus = 0.5
        % For mating 1x1 at locus = 1
    % These values are used as the probability that the offspring's locus 
    % will be filled with a 1 instead of 0. 
    % 1x1 matings are always filled with 1; 0x0 always with 0; 1x0 are
    % decided per a 50% chance. 

    % Female offspring
    % Assign these loci as above: 
    Of(:,3:nLoci+nLociP+2) = (rand(size(Of(:,3:nLoci+nLociP+2))) <= (Of(:,3:nLoci+nLociP+2)./2));
    % Store sum of own trait loci: (proportion 0/1) 
    Of(:,1) = sum(Of(:,3:(2+nLoci)),2)  ./ nLoci;
    % Store sum of own preference loci: (proportion 0/1) 
    Of(:,2) = sum(Of(:,(3+nLoci):(2+nLoci+nLociP)),2)  ./ nLociP;

    % Repeat for male offspring: 
    Om(:,3:nLoci+nLociP+2) = (rand(size(Om(:,3:nLoci+nLociP+2))) <= (Om(:,3:nLoci+nLociP+2)./2));
    %Store sum of own trait loci: (proportion 0/1) 
    Om(:,1) = sum(Om(:,3:(2+nLoci)),2)  ./ nLoci;
    % Store sum of own preference loci: (proportion 0/1) 
    Om(:,2) = sum(Om(:,(3+nLoci):(2+nLoci+nLociP)),2)  ./ nLociP;
